    "# How to Aggregate Categorical Replies via Crowdsourcing (Demo from ICML 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "*This example was originally posted on [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-aggregate-categorical-replies-via-crowdsourcing-demo-from-icml-2021-8u4j37hz).*\n",
    "\n",
    "We will aggregate categorical responses with the help of two classical algorithms – Majority Vote and Dawid-Skene.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll be using [Crowd-Kit](https://pypi.org/project/crowd-kit/), an open-source computational quality control library that offers efficient implementations of various quality control methods, including aggregation, uncertainty, agreements, and more. Crowd-Kit is designed to work with Python data science libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and pandas, while providing a very familiar programming experience with well-known concepts and APIs. It’s also platform agnostic. As soon as you provide the data as a table of annotators, tasks, and responses, the library will deliver high-quality output regardless of the platform you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demonstration, we will aggregate some responses provided by crowd annotators. For the project, they had to indicate whether the link to a target website was correct or not. Given that we asked multiple annotators to annotate each URL, we needed to choose the correct response, considering annotators’ skills and task difficulties. This was why we need aggregation. It’s a vast research topic, and there are many methods available for performing this task, most of which are based on probabilistic graphical models. Implementing them efficiently is another challenging task.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to install the Crowd-Kit library from the Python Package Index. We’ll also need annotated data. We’ll be using Toloka Aggregation Relevance [datasets](https://toloka.ai/datasets) with two categories: relevant and not relevant. These datasets contain anonymized data that is safe to work with. I’ll use the Crowd-Kit dataset downloader to download them from the Internet as pandas data frames. Again, feel free to use a different source of annotated data; open datasets are, naturally, fair play as well. Now we’re ready to go."

The label is set to `0` if the document is rated as non-relevant by the given annotator in the given task, otherwise the label will be `1`.
