    "# Aggregating Pairwise Comparison (Inspired by a Demo at ICML 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "*This example was originally posted on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/aggregating-pairwise-comparison-inspired-by-a-demo-at-icml-2021-c6fdc05680e2).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Many crowdsourcing tasks are designed to have only one correct answer, so the annotation is reduced to the well-studied classification task. In classification tasks, we use algorithms based on the latent label assumption: there is only one correct response, and the algorithm needs to recover the correct one. With popular answer aggregation libraries like spark-crowd, CEKA, or Truth Inference, you can do this quickly in the corresponding programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is not a one-size-fits-all method — after all, it assumes that the response is objective. But what if we want to evaluate search or recommendation quality, personal preferences, or other inherently subjective tasks? There might be no objective answer, and we can’t use latent label assumption. What we can do is learn from the crowd. Such tasks are usually designed as side-by-side tasks, also known as pairwise comparisons. Instead of choosing the correct response, the crowd annotator needs to select the more appealing option out of the two. As simple as this approach is, it can be used to handle highly complex tasks — ones that might require in-depth instructions and considerable design efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there is a special class of models for pairwise aggregation. The most famous of them is called the Bradley-Terry model, which was first mentioned in an [article published back in 1952](https://doi.org/10.2307/2334029). Different researchers and engineers have contributed to this model since then.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will show you how to aggregate pairwise comparisons using the Bradley-Terry model and its variation available in [Crowd-Kit](https://github.com/Toloka/crowd-kit). Crowd-Kit is an open-source computational quality control library that can be used to implement various quality control methods like aggregation, uncertainty, agreements, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate how to aggregate pairwise comparisons for readability estimation on a [well-known dataset](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kevynct/datasets/wsdm_rankagg_2013_readability_crowdflower_data.csv) by Chen et al. published at [WSDM ’13](https://doi.org/10.1145/2433396.2433420). They compared pairs of passages, asking the crowd annotators which of the two was more difficult to read. Each passage was additionally provided with a ground truth label on the 12-grade readability scale. The lower the grade, the simpler the text. This is an excellent example since we have raw crowdsourced data and ground truth labels to evaluate results."
